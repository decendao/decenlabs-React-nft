            We have designed the underlying archetypal talents for our Virtual Idols (see Meet Genesis VDOLs）.
            <br/>
            Virtual idols and influencers are gaining popularity every day, as they are scandal-free and do not age. There are no time or space constraints, and they are cheaper to work with than top celebrities in the long term.
            <br/>
            As a VDOL NFT holder, you will become part of the Talent Agency and develope with us the team on top of a unified foundation underpinned by the Roadmap and core principles.
            <br/>
            Yes, I think I know what you are thinking there, You can think of VDOL as the Loot project for Virtual Idols.

            Virtual Humans are the “foundation of the metaverse”. By breaking through the second dimension, and being more integrated into the real world, they are the messenger connecting virtual and reality.
            <br/>
            VDOL is a Metaverse Talent Agency allowing users to engage, fund, co-develope and become owners of metaverse-ready Virtual Idols.
